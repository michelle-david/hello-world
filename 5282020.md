### Best Day Ever! &copy;

Today was the hottest day of the week at 90+ degrees and so we took advantage of the sun by going out to a swimming hole for a dip. The rays were out in full force, so wading into a river was a perfect idea!

> Our dog didn't love wearing her lifevest, but it was very fun to watch her shake off the water after she went for a swim.

After I got home, I ate three cookies before getting ready for class. What a great day!
